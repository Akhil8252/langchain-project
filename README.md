*This is a project to generate a simple frontend application using streamlit. It provides us with the name of the restaurant based on the name of the cuisine and subsequently name of the food items.

* for this project i have used OPEN API and the langchain frame work. the application's functionality is similar to that of the chatgpt application of OpenAi
* *Note:- because of some issue in my codespace i am unable to push it directly. that is why i need to upload the file sperately. Also use your api key by simply making a file <i>config.json<i>.
